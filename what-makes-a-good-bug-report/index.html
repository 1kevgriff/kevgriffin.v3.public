<p>Developers are terrible at testing their own software.  I'm my own worst tester, and that's because I have a large understanding of how it works.  Without trying, I can make the software work flawlessly each and every time.  On my teams, I state that I want others using my code as much as possible.  But what happens if something breaks?</p>
<p>Hopefully your company employs a bug track of some sort.  For example, my company uses FogBugz for all of our bug tracking.  However, not many people in my company understand how to write a useful bug report.  My goal is to outline some of the minor things that can be done to make a bug report more helpful to the developer who's going to be using it.</p>
<h1>1. Use descriptive titles</h1>
Whenever I see a bug with a title like "Got an error in (name a section of the app)", I die a little inside.  I also see bug titles every day where it's just the name of the section of the app, for example "Order Screen" or "Customer Profile".  Imagine you're a developer who's going through a bug list.  I tend to put these bugs off until later because in order to figure out what I need to do, I have to open the bug.
<p>Instead, let's try for bug titles like this: "Error 'unable to save user information' when on the user profile screen".  I know what the error is, and where it is.  That's helpful!  Or "Order Confirmation: Clicking OK doesn't respond".  Again, very helpful.  As the developer, I don't have to guess what the problem is.</p>
<h1>2. Steps to reproduce</h1>
For the past few weeks, we've had this intermittent problem when saving a user's profile.  Every single time it's occurred, I'm nowhere near the tester.  I've been unable to reproduce it.  Every time it happens, I ask "what was the input?" and I'm constantly answered with "I don't know".  Without a details list of steps for reproducing the bug, I cannot guarantee that I'll be able to fix the bug.  When using guideline #3, you can save a lot of time.
<h1>3. Screen shots, screen shots, screen shots</h1>
A picture is worth a 1,000 words.  If you're having trouble verbalizing what the problem is, take a screen shot.  Please make sure that a screen shot is worthwhile though.  If you're working on a web application, and it renders correctly in Firefox, but not in IE, take a screen shot!  If you've filled out a 15 field form, and it errors out, take a screen shot!  When used in combination with guideline #2, you don't have to write out all the information typed into the form.
<h1>4. Prioritize correctly</h1>
When you're adding a bug to the system, take into consideration how important fixing the bug is to the current or next release.  If there is a misspelled word, I wouldn't classify it as a "MUST FIX!".  Instead, you should be giving it a lower priority, such as a "Medium" or "When there is time".  If the system is unable to process customer orders, which is the sole reason for using the system, then you might want to mark that as a "MUST FIX!".
<p>This guideline is subjective though.  The person in charge of the next release, a project manager or lead developer, should have final say over what priority a bug is.</p>
<h1>5. Expectations</h1>
If the system did something you didn't quite expect to happen, let the developer know.  In many cases, whatever happened was the product working as designed.  This is a perfect opportunity to discuss flow of application.  One person's design might not make sense to someone else.
<p>For example, if the app allows you to hand type in dates, but only in the DD/MM/YYYY format and you typed in MM/DD/YYYY format, the system will fail.  That's not exactly a bug, because the system is set up to only accept dates in a certain format, but it is a bug in terms that the system didn't do what you expected.</p>
<h1>6. One Issue Per Bug Report</h1>
I can understand how tedious it must be to create a bug report.  Seriously, what is it?  Two, maybe three clicks?  When creating a bug report, make sure you're only referencing one issue.  That way individual issues can be prioritized and worked on solely by themselves.  Verification can be done on a single issue, and not a group.  When you list multiple items in a bug, you're risking that one item might be missed.  Additionally, if I'm the developer on the bug, I can't close it out until all items in the bug have been satisfied.  I might be able to fix all but one item, and the bug will remain in the tracker until I have time or resources to fix it.  If the bugs were individual, I could close out all the fixed issues and they could be evaluated again.
<hr />When writing your next bug report, please take these guidelines into account and make it easier on your developers.
<p>I welcome any question or comments!  What do you think?  Anything you would add to the list?  Remove?  Let me know in the comments!</p>
