A long time ago I read a book that discussed traits of successful people, and the number one similarity I saw was that successful people tend to read A LOT.  Since 2016 is wrapping up, I took a couple minutes to look through the list of books I was able to get through.  </p>\n<p>My list distinctly separates fiction from non-fiction.  I <em>love</em> reading good fiction, and it's just as important for stories and fantasy to be a part of your reading schedule as it is to read non-fiction.  Escape a little!</p>\n<p>I'm going to list the books in no particular order!  I won't give much commentary, because I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to someone with no basic understand of personal finance.

The best success I've ever had has been on the ketogentic diet.  Traditional philosophy failed me.  Come to find out, traditional thinking on diets is completely wrong, and possibly killing people.  This book provides a ton of research and science into why we've been lied to regarding nutrition.  </p>\n<p>As a side note, I've done a bit of research outside of this book and I tend to agree with most of what it says.  Everyone is different, so do your own research and form your own opinions.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/1591847745/ref=as_li_ss_il?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1483115256&sr=1-1&keywords=How+to+Fail+at+Almost+Everything+and+Still+Win+Big&linkCode=li3&tag=kevgr-20&linkId=9e68e33e6e50841bb6033aa2805d1074\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1591847745&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=kevgr-20\" ></a><img src=\"https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=kevgr-20&l=li3&o=1&a=1591847745\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />\n<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2iNicim\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big</a> by Scott Adams</p>\n<p>Also picked up on a whim.  If you feel like you're failing or not progressing fast enough, give this book a read.  Scott Adams is the guy who write Dilbert.  That wasn't an overnight success.  There were dozens of failed experiments before Dilbert, all providing Scott Adams with new knowledge and skills.  And it's funny!

Take a lot of his advice with a grain of salt.  Do your own research.  SHORT read.
