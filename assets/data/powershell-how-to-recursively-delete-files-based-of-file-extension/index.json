That is apparently harder than it sounds, because it took me 15 minutes to figure out the correct command line.</p>\n<p>So you don't go fumbling like I did:</p>\n<pre><code>Get-ChildItem . -recurse -include *.orig | remove-item\n</code></pre>\n<p>Replace <code>.</code> and <code>*.orig</code> accordingly.  Have fun!</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
