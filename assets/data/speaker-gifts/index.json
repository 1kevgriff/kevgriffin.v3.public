In fact, a large majority of the technical speaker circuit is filled with unpaid speakers.  Not only that, the speaker might incur costs just for having come out.</p>\n<p><strong>What costs would a speaker have?</strong><br>\nGreat question!  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gas</strong><br>\nLet's imagine someone is driving ~4-8 hours round trip to visit a user group.  This will include one or two tanks of gas, depending on the type of vehicle you're driving.</li>\n<li><strong>Hotel</strong><br>\nIf I'm driving more than 4 hours in one direction to visit a user group, I probably want to get a hotel for the night.  </li>\n<li><strong>Lost wages</strong><br>\nOdds are if I'm driving to a user group, I need to take the afternoon off work.  This means I'm burning PTO or (if you're like me), you're not billing time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Organizations like <a href=\"http://www.ineta.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">INETA</a> have programs to help offset the costs of for speakers.  For example, if I were to travel over 360 miles, INETA will reimburse me $200 for the trip.  That's pretty good and covers most of my costs of speaking.</p>\n<p><strong>How can the user group help?</strong><br>\nI understand that asking you to cover speaker costs is a huge thing.  So I'm not going to do that.  Still assume that speakers will come of their own freewill and will cover their own costs.</p>\n<p>Consider this: Your goal as a user group leader is to promote the local technology scene.  You want to attract people to show up and learn, but you also want to attract great speakers!</p>\n<p>A couple months ago, our user group started a process of giving out speaker gifts.  We don't promote it (\"HEY EVERYONE!  LOOK AT US GIVING A SPEAKER GIFT!\").  Instead, the speaker loves the thought behind the gift and keeps us in mind for a return visit in the future.</p>\n<p>These speakers will then talk about you to their speaker friends.  \"Hey, those guys at the Hampton Roads .NET group are really cool.  I definitely recommend getting on their calendar.\"</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of gift can we give?</strong><br>\nWe just give a $50 Amazon gift card in one of the fancy boxes.  That's pretty good, and it's a cost we subsidize with sponsor money.</p>\n<p>A couple months ago, I visited a group called <a href=\"http://migang.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GANG</a> where they gave me a engraved metal mug.  That was awesome, and it makes me definitely want to come back.</p>\n<p>Why not start simple and give the speaker a thank you card signed by all the organizers and some of the attendees?  Every little bit you can do makes a difference.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
