User groups, code camps, MADExpo (I'd link to it, but sadly the site went away a couple months ago), and others.</p>
<p>They are always the same.  <em>If you build it, they will come.</em></p>
<p>I really don't want that to sound negative, because it's not meant to.  The leaders in the community are amazing, and lose a lot of sleep making sure an event is a success.  And if it's a free event, they do all that knowing that potentially over 30-50% of the people that promised to attend will skip.</p>
<p>Heck, even a paid event isn't much better.  When we cancelled MADExpo in 2013, I received numerous comments from people saying "Oh, I was looking so forward to MADExpo this year!"  That's awesome!  Why didn't buy a ticket?  </p>
<p>Since the cancellation of MADExpo, I've been itching to do something new in our area.  However, the model of <em>build it, and they come</em> didn't seem like it worked anymore.  At least, not for a new event.</p>
<p>By the pressure of my partner-in-crime, <a href="http://fishbrains.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bret Fisher</a>, I've been listening through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4XGN6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=B004J4XGN6&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=kevgr-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Lean Startup</a>.  The chapter on building a minimum viable product struct a chord with me.  Build the absolute minimum to start the learning process of what people want.</p>
<p>Over the course of two days, I built the minimum viable product for <a href="http://757devcon.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">757DevCon</a>.  It's strictly an interest site.  I'm throwing out an idea, and you can register for my list if you want to hear more.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, I have a series of emails planned out to extract crucial information I need from my potential customers.  It's not so much about what they want from a conference, but what are they willing to pay for?</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for?  Go <a href="http://757devcon.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">get on the list</a>, and I'll keep you updated!</p>
<p>I'd love to hear your questions and thoughts.  Post them in the comments below.</p>
